# Cipher
What my project is called, and what it does:

My project is a cipher that I coded, in which the user can input a message to encrypt, and then decrypt. The cipher converts the user's message to symbols, and can be decoded. It's called cipher because I couldn't come up with a more creative name haha

Why I made my project:
I made it mostly to start learning python again. (I learned it when I was in middle school and have since forgotten how to use all of it) I actually learned how to make dictionaries for this project, though I think there has to be a better way of making the decoding dictionary. (I will look into this.)

How I made my project:
I used VS code to make this project, and I took quite a bit of time googling how to use dictionaries. I also kind of experimented a little bit since I usually work with java.

What I struggled with:
As mentioned before, I struggled a bit with the dictionary, but I am pleased to say that python sytax is much more forgiving than Java for the most part. I learned how to use dictionaries, define functions, and call functions in python.
